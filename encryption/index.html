# Why use (email) encryption?

Because no-one has "nothing to hide".  Everyone has something to hide
-- having secrets has nothing to to with doing anything illegal or
immoral.

You would not put these kinds of information on a postcard (for anyone
to see) or risk someone being able to read them if for example your
laptop was lost or stolen:

* a message to your family telling them where you hid a key
* medical information
* personal correspondence
* embarrassing information
* passwords
* corporate (or personal) secrets
* credit card number or PIN
* social security number
* anything that leaves you vulnerable to identity theft

You wouldn't send this kind of information on a postcard -- you would
at the very least use an envelope.

Why then would you send personal or confidential information in an
unprotected email?  Sending an unencrypted email is the equivalent of
writing it on a postcard for all to see.

## We can't know what secrets we will have to keep tomorrow

We have no way of knowing today what secrets we will have to keep
tomorrow.  We may suddenly find that something we did which was
perfectly legal today is suddenly illegal in the future.

Keeping information private is the only way of making sure than no-one
can use it against us (in ways we may not expect) in the future.
