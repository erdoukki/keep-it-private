# Why Use (Email) Encryption?

Because no-one has "nothing to hide".  Everyone has something to hide
-- having secrets has nothing to do with doing anything illegal or
immoral.

You would not put the following kinds of information on a postcard
(for anyone to see) or risk someone being able to read them if for
example your laptop was lost or stolen:

* a message to your family telling them where you hid a key
* medical information
* personal correspondence
* embarrassing information
* passwords
* corporate (or personal) secrets
* credit card number or PIN
* social security number
* anything that leaves you vulnerable to identity theft

You wouldn't send this kind of information on a postcard -- you would
at the very least use an envelope.

Why then would you send personal or confidential information in an
unprotected email?  Sending an unencrypted email is the equivalent of
writing it on a postcard for all to see.

## We Can't Know What Secrets We Will Have (to Keep) Tomorrow

We have no way of knowing today what secrets we will have to keep
tomorrow.  We may suddenly find that something we did which was
perfectly legal today is suddenly illegal in the future.

Keeping information private is the only way of making sure than no-one
can use it against us (in ways we may not expect) in the future.

# How Can Encryption Protect My Secrets?

Encryption allows you to securely store and/or transmit messages and
data; and to verify that a message was not modified in transit and was
created by a known sender.

  * encrypted files on a laptop or USB flash drive can only
    be read by someone who knows the passphrase (data "at rest")

  * encrypted emails can only be read by the intended
    recipient(s) (data in transit)

  * digital signatures protect the integrity and authenticity of a
    message (or file)

  * encrypted connections to servers (e.g. https for websites) prevent
    eavesdropping and give a reasonable guarantee that one is
    communicating with precisely the web site that one intended to
    communicate with (as opposed to an imposter)

  * encrypted text/audio/video chat connections keep conversations
    private

# What Can't Encryption Do?

Encryption can't protect you against what other people do with the
information you give them.  You'll still need to trust them.

Sending someone an encrypted message only they can read, doesn't
guarantee the contents stay secure.

Someone you have sent an encrypted email to can (accidentally) make
the information public; e.g. by

  * (accidentally) replying to your email without encrypting it
  * forwarding it to someone else

And an encrypted connection does not prevent e.g. your email provider
from reading your messages -- only encryption of the messages
themselves can do that.

name: privacy

# There's More to Privacy Than Encryption

Encryption is only part of privacy protection.  Sending encrypted
email does not protect you against people/corporations/governments
tracking what you do, where you are, who you communicate with, etc.

Encryption does not prevent tracking and does not provide anonymity.

# What Is Encryption?

> Encryption is the process of **encoding messages (or information) in
such a way that third parties cannot read it, and only authorized
parties can**.

> In an encryption scheme, the message or information (referred to as
**plaintext**) is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, turning it
into an unreadable **ciphertext**.  This is usually done with the use
of an **encryption key**, which specifies how the message is to be
encoded.

> Any adversary that can see the ciphertext should not be able to
determine anything about the original message.  An authorized party,
however, is able to decode the ciphertext using a decryption
algorithm, which usually requires a secret decryption key, that
adversaries do not have access to.

---

name: what-sig

# What Are Digital Signatures?

> A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for **demonstrating the
authenticity of a digital message or document**.  A valid digital
signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was
**created by a known sender**, such that the sender **cannot deny
having sent the message** (**authentication** and **non-repudiation**)
and that **the message was not altered in transit** (**integrity**).
Digital signatures are commonly used for software distribution,
financial transactions, and in other cases where it is important to
detect forgery or tampering.

name: kinds

# Kinds of Encryption

## Symmetric Key Encryption

> In Symmetric-key schemes, the encryption and decryption keys are the
same.  Thus communicating parties must agree on a secret key before
they wish to communicate.

## Public Key Encryption

> In public-key encryption schemes, the encryption key is **published
for anyone to use and encrypt messages**.  However, **only the
receiving party has access to the decryption key** and is capable of
reading the encrypted messages.  Public-key encryption is a relatively
recent invention: historically, all encryption schemes have been
symmetric-key (also called private-key) schemes.

# Symmetric Key Cryptography

> Symmetric-key cryptography uses the same keys for both encryption of
plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.  The keys, in practice,
represent a **shared secret between two or more parties that can be
used to maintain a private information link**.  This requirement that
both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main
drawbacks of symmetric key encryption, in comparison to public-key
encryption.  This is also known as private key encryption.

---

## Sending a Message Using Symmetric-key Encryption

When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she encrypts the message
(plaintext) with the shared key and can now send the ciphertext to Bob
via an insecure channel (like the internet).

When Bob receives the ciphertext from Alice, he decrypts it using the
shared key.

Alice and Bob will need to exchange the shared key beforehand, using a
secure channel (e.g. they meet in person to generate the key).

## Using a USB Flash Drive Encrypted Using Symmetric-key Cryptography

John has created an encrypted USB flash drive.  When he connects it to
his computer, he is prompted for his key (passphrase).  When he enters
the correct key, he can use the flash drive as any other.  Anyone
without his key will only see garbage.

---

name: pubkey

# Public Key Cryptography

> Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography,
requires **two separate keys, one of which is secret (or private) and
one of which is public**.  Although different, the two parts of this
key pair are mathematically linked.  The public key is used to
**encrypt plaintext or to verify a digital signature**; whereas the
private key is used to **decrypt ciphertext or to create a digital
signature**.  The term "asymmetric" stems from the use of different
keys to perform these opposite functions, each the inverse of the
other -- as contrasted with conventional ("symmetric") cryptography
which relies on the same key to perform both.

> An analogy to public-key encryption is that of a **locked mail box
with a mail slot**.  The mail slot is exposed and accessible to the
public -- its location (the street address) is, in essence, the public
key.  Anyone knowing the street address can go to the door and drop a
written message through the slot.  However, only the person who
possesses the key can open the mailbox and read the message.

> An analogy for digital signatures is the** sealing of an envelope
with a personal wax seal**.  The message can be opened by anyone, but
the presence of the unique seal authenticates the sender.

## Sending a Message Using Public-key Encryption

When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she encrypts the message
(plaintext) with his public key and can now send the ciphertext to Bob
via an insecure channel (like the internet).

When Bob receives the ciphertext from Alice, he decrypts it using his
private key.

If Alice also signes the message using her private key, Bob can use
her public key to verify that the message was sent by Alice and has
not been modified in transit.

Alice and Bob will need to exchange public keys beforehand, e.g. by
email or using a public key server.  They will need to meet in person
-- or at least communicate in a manner which guarantees both of them
they are not communicating with an imposter -- to verify each has the
correct public key (and not an imposter's) by checking the
fingerprint.

# Using Encryption

## Hard Disks and USB Flash Drives

### Linux

Most distributions allow you to set up hard disk encryption when
installing.  You can use cryptsetup or the gnome disk utility to
create encrypted USB flash drives.

## Email

GnuPG is a free software public-key (and symmetric) encryption
program.  The Enigmail plugin for the Thunderbird email program uses
GnuPG to allow you to send and receive encrypted email.

## Send All Email Encrypted

You should sign and encrypt all of your messages, not just the most
sensitive ones.  If you only encrypt that single email with your
credit card information, an eavesdropper will see one encrypted
message among 99% unencrypted ones.  So you might as well have
attached a bright red neon sign that says "Hack Me" to that message.
