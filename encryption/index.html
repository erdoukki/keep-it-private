# Why use (email) encryption?

Because no-one has "nothing to hide".  Everyone has something to hide
-- having secrets has nothing to to with doing anything illegal or
immoral.

You would not put these kinds of information on a postcard (for anyone
to see) or risk someone being able to read them if for example your
laptop was lost or stolen:

* a message to your family telling them where you hid a key
* medical information
* personal correspondence
* embarrassing information
* passwords
* corporate (or personal) secrets
* credit card number or PIN
* social security number
* anything that leaves you vulnerable to identity theft

You wouldn't send this kind of information on a postcard -- you would
at the very least use an envelope.

Why then would you send personal or confidential information in an
unprotected email?  Sending an unencrypted email is the equivalent of
writing it on a postcard for all to see.

## We can't know what secrets we will have (to keep) tomorrow

We have no way of knowing today what secrets we will have to keep
tomorrow.  We may suddenly find that something we did which was
perfectly legal today is suddenly illegal in the future.

Keeping information private is the only way of making sure than no-one
can use it against us (in ways we may not expect) in the future.

name: how

# How can encryption protect my secrets?

Encryption allows you to securely store and/or transmit messages and
data; and to verify that a message was not modified in transit and was
created by a known sender.

  * encrypted files on a laptop or USB flash drive can only
    be read by someone who knows the passphrase (data "at rest")

  * encrypted emails can only be read by the intended
    recipient(s) (data in transit)

  * digital signatures protect the integrity and authenticity of a
    message (or file)

  * encrypted connections to servers (e.g. https for websites) prevent
    eavesdropping and give a reasonable guarantee that one is
    communicating with precisely the web site that one intended to
    communicate with (as opposed to an imposter)

  * encrypted text/audio/video chat connections keep conversations
    private

name: what-not

# What can't encryption do?

Encryption can't protect you against what other people do with the
information you give them.  You'll still need to trust them.

Sending someone an encrypted message only they can read, doesn't
guarantee the contents stay secure.

Someone you have sent an encrypted email to can (accidentally) make
the information public; e.g. by

  * (accidentally) replying to your email without encrypting it
  * forwarding it to someone else

And an encrypted connection does not prevent e.g. your email provider
from reading your messages -- only encryption of the messages
themselves can do that.

name: privacy

# There's more to privacy than encryption

Encryption is only part of privacy protection.  Sending encrypted
email does not protect you against people/corporations/governments
tracking what you do, where you are, who you communicate with, etc.

Encryption does not prevent tracking and does not provide anonymity.

name: what

# What is encryption?

> Encryption is the process of encoding messages (or information) in
such a way that third parties cannot read it, and only authorized
parties can.  In an encryption scheme, the message or information
(referred to as plaintext) is encrypted using an encryption algorithm,
turning it into an unreadable ciphertext.  This is usually done with
the use of an encryption key, which specifies how the message is to be
encoded.  Any adversary that can see the ciphertext should not be able
to determine anything about the original message.  An authorized
party, however, is able to decode the ciphertext using a decryption
algorithm, that usually requires a secret decryption key, that
adversaries do not have access to.

name: what-sig

# What are digital signatures?

> A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the
authenticity of a digital message or document.  A valid digital
signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was
created by a known sender, such that the sender cannot deny having
sent the message (authentication and non-repudiation) and that the
message was not altered in transit (integrity).  Digital signatures
are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions,
and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or
tampering.

name: kinds

# Kinds of encryption

## Symmetric key encryption

> In Symmetric-key schemes, the encryption and decryption keys are the
same.  Thus communicating parties must agree on a secret key before
they wish to communicate.

## Public key encryption

> In public-key encryption schemes, the encryption key is published
for anyone to use and encrypt messages.  However, only the receiving
party has access to the decryption key and is capable of reading the
encrypted messages.  Public-key encryption is a relatively recent
invention: historically, all encryption schemes have been
symmetric-key (also called private-key) schemes.
