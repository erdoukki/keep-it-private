# Why use (email) encryption?

Because no-one has "nothing to hide".  Everyone has something to hide
-- having secrets has nothing to to with doing anything illegal or
immoral.

You would not put these kinds of information on a postcard (for anyone
to see) or risk someone being able to read them if for example your
laptop was lost or stolen:

* a message to your family telling them where you hid a key
* medical information
* personal correspondence
* embarrassing information
* passwords
* corporate (or personal) secrets
* credit card number or PIN
* social security number
* anything that leaves you vulnerable to identity theft

You wouldn't send this kind of information on a postcard -- you would
at the very least use an envelope.

Why then would you send personal or confidential information in an
unprotected email?  Sending an unencrypted email is the equivalent of
writing it on a postcard for all to see.

## We can't know what secrets we will have (to keep) tomorrow

We have no way of knowing today what secrets we will have to keep
tomorrow.  We may suddenly find that something we did which was
perfectly legal today is suddenly illegal in the future.

Keeping information private is the only way of making sure than no-one
can use it against us (in ways we may not expect) in the future.

# How can encryption protect my secrets?

Encryption allows you to securely store and/or transmit messages and
data.  You can use it to:

  * send emails that only the intended recipient(s) can read
  * protect the files on your laptop from being read by anyone but you
  * etc.

---

name: what-not

# What can't encryption do?

Encryption can't protect you against what other people do with the
information you give them.  You'll still need to trust them.

Sending someone an encrypted message only they can read, doesn't
guarantee the contents stay secure.

Someone you have sent an encrypted email to can (accidentally) make
the information public; e.g. by

  * (accidentally) replying to your email without encrypting it
  * forwarding it to someone else

---

name: privacy

# There's more to privacy than encryption

Encryption is only part of privacy protection.  Sending encrypted
email does not protect you against people/corporations/governments
tracking what you do, where you are, who you communicate with, etc.
