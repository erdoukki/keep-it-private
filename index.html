# Intended Usage

These presentations are meant to be used (whole or in part) at
**CryptoParties** or similar gatherings (in which case the presenter
will most likely not use all of the text -- which is why the most
important words in each slide with significant amounts of text are in
bold).

At the same time they are meant to serve as an **online resource** for
**self-study** and **reference** (e.g. to read up on some details
after a CryptoParty).

<br/>

# Indended Audience

They are meant for **non-technical** and **technical** audiences
alike; less technical audiences can for example skip some of the
background and explanation on excryption and focus on the **diagrams**
of email and public key cryptography as well as the **practical
aspects**.
