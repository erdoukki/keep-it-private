# Why privacy matters

.medium[

> Privacy is a **fundamental human right**.  It is recognized in many
countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social
values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech.  Simply put,
privacy is **the border where we draw a line between how far a society
can intrude into our personal lives**.

> Today, a further facet of privacy increasingly perceived is **the
personal data we provide to organizations**, online as well as
offline.  How our personal data is used and accessed drives the debate
about the laws that govern our behavior and society.  This in turn has
knock-on effects on the public services we access and how businesses
interact with us.  It even has effects on how we define ourselves.  If
privacy is about **the borders which govern who we give permission to
watch us and track aspects of our lives**, then the amount and type of
personal information gathered, disseminated and processed is paramount
to our basic civil liberties.

> An often heard argument, when questions of privacy and anonymity
come up, goes along the lines of, **"I only do boring stuff.  Nobody
will be interested in it anyway"** or, **"I have nothing to hide"**.
Both of these statements are easily defeated.  Firstly, a lot of
companies are very interested in what boring things you do precisely
so they have opportunity to offer "excellent" products fitting
interests.  In this way their **advertising** becomes much more
efficient -- they are able to **tailor specifically to assumed needs
and desires**.  Secondly **you do have lots to hide**.  Maybe you do
not express it in explicitly stated messages to friends and
colleagues, but your browsing -- if not protected -- **will tell a lot
about things you might rather keep secret**: the ex-partner you search
for using Google, illnesses you research or movies you watch are just
few examples.  Another consideration is that just because you might
not have something to hide at this moment, **you may very well in
future**.

> An obsessed, persistent **stalker**, for example, is enough to
heavily disrupt your life.  The more you protect your privacy, the
less impact attacks like this will have on you.  **Companies** may
also stalk you too, finding more and more ways to **reach into your
daily life** as the reach of computer networking itself deepens.

> Finally, a lack of anonymity and privacy does not just affect you,
but **all the people around you**.  If a third party, like your
Internet Service Provider, reads your email, it is also violating the
privacy of all the people in your address book.  This problem starts
to look even more dramatic when you look at the issues of social
networking websites like Facebook.  It is increasingly common to see
**photos uploaded and tagged without the knowledge or permission of
the people affected**.

> Each of us has the right to a private life, a right to explore,
browse and communicate with others as one wishes, without living in
fear of prying eyes.

> Putting together all the tools and skills to protect yourself from
surveillance takes practice, trust and a bit of effort.
