# Why Privacy Matters

Because **knowlege is power.**

.medium[

> Franz Kafka's *The Trial*: "A man is arrested and prosecuted;
**everything is secret**, from the charge, to the rules of the court,
to the authority behind the courts.  An inaccessible, inscrutable
bureaucratic authority uses **people's information** to make
**important decisions** about them, whilst **denying them access** to
what information is **gathered** and how it is **used**."

]

Privacy is **not about hiding bad things**.  Seemingly **innocuous
data** can be gathered, **aggregated** and **analysed** to become much
more than the sum of its parts.  It creates a **power imbalance**
between people and governments (or corporations).

When data is aggregated and analysed, with no **accountability**, no
**access** to ones data, and no possibility to correct **errors** and
**distortion**, **faulty inferences** will be drawn.  For example,
your **pattern of activities** might be incorrectly **construed as
criminal**.

And so far we've assumed **good intentions**; imagine what
**carelessness**, **incompetence** and **malice** can do.

On top of this, **surveillance** results in **inhibition** and
**social control**.  **Data theft** can lead to **identity theft**,
**blackmail**, etc.  And what seems like harmless information today,
may become something you need to hide **tomorrow**.

## From the CryptoParty Handbook:

> Privacy is a **fundamental human right**.  It is recognized in many
countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social
values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech.  Simply put,
privacy is the border where we **draw a line** between how far a
**society** can **intrude** into our **personal lives**.

> Finally, a lack of anonymity and privacy does not just affect you,
but **all the people around you**.  If a third party, like your
Internet Service Provider, reads your email, it is also violating the
privacy of all the people in your address book.  This problem starts
to look even more dramatic when you look at the issues of social
networking websites like Facebook.  It is increasingly common to see
photos uploaded and tagged **without** the **knowledge** or
**permission** of the **people affected**.

> Each of us has the right to a **private life**, a right to
**explore**, **browse** and **communicate** with others as one wishes,
without living in fear of **prying eyes**.

name: warnings

# Warnings

* There are **no guarantees**.
* **Nothings lasts** forever.
* **Discipline** is required.
* You will need to (be able to) **trust** your operating system,
  software, friends/family/colleagues, ...

<!-- -->

* Privacy Threats apply to **Mobile Devices** (e.g. Smartphones) as well.
  - And those are often **not** under **your control**.

<!-- -->

* Beware of **metadata** (e.g. email headers, GPS coordinates).
* Using secure connections and/or encryption still **gives away
  information** about **which servers and people** you communicate
  with (e.g.  https, pgp keyserver, apt).

name: fears

# Fears

* Who can read the email messages that I have already sent or received?
* Who can read the emails I send when they travel across the Internet?
* Can the people I send emails to share them with anybody?

<!-- -->

* What if somebody gets complete control of my email account?
* I logged in from an insecure location... how do I know now if my
  account has been hacked?
* I've done nothing wrong... what do I have to hide?
* Why would anybody care about me?

<!-- -->

* Something I wrote infuriated a person in power... how do I protect
  myself?

name: browsing

# Browsing

* Visiting a website gives away information about yourself.
  - You leave **footprints**.
  - You have **no control** over how this information is used and by whom.
* Your browsing is **tracked** by sites and third parties.
  - Use anti-tracking software.
* **Search providers** track what you search for.
  - Use search anonymising software.
  - Use search services that take privacy seriously, like
    [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) and
    [startpage](https://startpage.com).
* You could get in trouble if the **intentions** behind your searches are
  **miscontrued**.

<!-- -->

* It is wiser to trust **Free Software** Browsers like
  [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox).
* You have the right to remain anonymous.
  - Hide your IP Address using **anonymising tools** like Tor.

<!-- -->

* Connections are routed via **many different computers**.
  - Use **secure connections**.
    * Use [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).
* Cross Site Scripting can allow malicious web sites to **hijack** others.
  - Use [NoScript](http://noscript.net).

---

name: social

# Social Networking

* You are the **product** -- the **advertiser** is the customer.
* Personal information is **collected**, **aggregated**, and **analysed**.
* You have **no control** over your personal information.
  - **Economic** interests of the service provider and third parties.
  - **Surveillance** and political/legal demands (in the service
    provider's **jurisdiction**).
* You may be at rick from **predators** and social engineering
  **attacks**.

---

name: tracking

# Tracking

* Your browsing is **tracked**.
* You will get **advertisements** based on a personal **profile**.
* Other **parties** (like your insurance company, employer and the
  authorities) are also very interested in your browsing history.
* You could even get arrested for **"suspicious surfing"**.

## Prevent Tracking

* Delete **cookies**.
* **Private Browsing**.
* Use add-ons like ...TODO... <!-- AdBlockPlus -->

## Warning

Blocking trackers gives you more privacy, but your **IP Address** and
**Internet Traffic** are still visible to others.

---

name: anon

# Anonymity

* Hide your IP Address:
  - Use a **Proxy**.
  - Use a **VPN**.
  - Use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org).

## Warnings

* Use **separate accounts** and profiles and **never** use them together.
* Beware of **metadata**.
  - **GPS coordinates in photos!**
* Don't mention or use anything that can be used to **identify you**.
  - This even includes your writing style.

---

name: secure-calls

# Secure Calls and SMS

* GSM and SMS can be **intercepted**.
* Centralised or proprietary systems like Skype have built in
  **backdoors**.
* Use **Free Software** VoIP with **encryption**.
  - Like [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org).
* Use **XMPP** Chat with **OTR** encryption.

---

name: free-sw

# The Necessity of Free Software

* You cannot fully **trust** software whose **inner workings** are barred from
  **public inspection**.
* Security methods must not be required to be secret.
* Publishing methods and inner workings allows potential
  **weaknesses** to be **found** instead of **hidden**.
